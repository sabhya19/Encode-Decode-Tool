# Encode-Decode-Tool
Secure data encryption has been a major challenge since ages and numerous cryptographic algorithms have been designed ever since. The goal of an encryption algorithm is to secure confidential data by preventing unauthorized decryption, for which a key is generated. The proposed algorithm converts plain text to ciphertext. The intended destination/user then uses this cipher to decode it. 
The proposed algorithm uses graph data structures to generate ciphertext from plain text containing capital and miniscule letters/words, separated by spaces. The idea is to represent the ‘ones’ in binary equivalents of characters as vertices of a graph and then to trace the hamiltonian cycle to generate cipher. Decoding is done in the reverse manner.The proposed optimized tool handles capital and miniscule characters, along with punctuations. The terminal application serves a purpose to encrypt simple english sentences, in a memory and time efficient manner.
